You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Eliptical talk. Congratulations, you played yourself. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough?
